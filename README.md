This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Justin Kim, Louis Jensen, Louis Lee

### Timeline

Start Date: 2019/01/29

Finish Date: 2019/02/04

Hours Spent: 30+(individually)

### Primary Roles

We worked as a group for the whole project. 

### Resources Used

Stack Overflow, google images. 

### Running the Program

Main class: Visualization.class

Data files needed: All in the resources folder

Interesting data files: x

Features implemented: In GUI, we have upload, play one round, play, pause, fast forward,
reset speed, initialize buttons. We implemented all the algorithms needed 
for SpreadingFire, GameofLife, Percolation, PredatorPrey and Segregation. 

Assumptions or Simplifications: 

For the PredatorPrey, tickstoreproduce should always be bigger than the reproduction time
because otherwise sharks will live too long.

Known Bugs: 

1. We did implement Resource bundle, but for some unknown reason, 
resourcebundle creates error in Mac and Linux. On windows, it works fine. 

2. If the gridsize is too big, then due the integer division error,
grid might not be perfect. 

Extra credit: 
1. We simplified the cell class as much as we can. We minimized 
the number of variables within the cell class. 

2. We implemented alert buttons in GUI. 

### Notes
We are excited for sprint #2 !!!

### Impressions

This was a good project. We split up the work very evenly and distributed the amount of work over many days to reduce cramming.
