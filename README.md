### Timeline

Start Date: 2019/01/29

Finish Date: 2019/02/04

Hours Spent: 30+(individually)

### Primary Roles

We worked as a group for the whole project. 

### Resources Used

Stack Overflow, google images. 

### Running the Program

Main class: Visualization.class

Data files needed: All in the resources folder

Interesting data files: x

Features implemented: In GUI, we have upload, play one round, play, pause, fast forward,
reset speed, initialize buttons. We implemented all the algorithms needed 
for SpreadingFire, GameofLife, Percolation, PredatorPrey and Segregation. 

Assumptions or Simplifications: 

Known Bugs: We did implement Resource bundle, but for some unknown reason, 
resourcebundle creates error in Mac and Linux. On windows, it works fine. 

Extra credit: We simplified the cell class as much as we can. We minimized 
the number of variables within the cell class.
